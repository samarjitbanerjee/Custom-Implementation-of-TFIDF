Please implement the TFIDf function such that for each word in a sentence, its corresponding tfidf value is assigned. Thus a 4 x 6 sized matrix should be returned where the rows represent sentences and the columns represent words. We wish to keep it simple in the beginning.\n","\n","2. In reality the TFIDF function should return a matrix where the rows represent sentences and the columns represent words (ie: Features). Every sentence vector in this matrix will be 'd' dimensional, where d = number of unique words in the corpus (ie: Vocabulary).\n","Every position/cell in a sentence vector correponds to a particular word in the vocabulary. If the word is not present in the current sentence, we assign a value of 0 to that cell, else we assign the TFIDF value."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0vrZdUum2xPk"},"source":["# **Implement TF-IDF from scratch**\n","\n","In this assignment, you will implement TF-IDF vectorization of text from scratch using only Python and inbuilt data structures. You will then verify the correctness of the your implementation using a \"grader\" function/cell (provided by us) which will match your implmentation.\n","\n","The grader fucntion would help you validate the correctness of your code. \n","\n","Please submit the final Colab notebook in the classroom ONLY after you have verified your code using the grader function/cell.\n","\n","**(FAQ) Why bother about implementing a function to compute TF-IDF when it is already available in major libraries?**\n","\n","Ans.\n","1. It helps you improve your coding proficiency.\n","2. It helps you obtain a deeper understanding of the concepts and how it works internally. Knowledge of the internals will also help you debug problems better.\n","3. A lot of product based startups and companies do focus on this in thier interviews to gauge your depth and clarity of understanding along with your programming skills. Hence, most top universities have implementations of some ML algorithms/concepts as mandatory assignments.\n","\n","**NOTE: DO NOT change the \"grader\" functions or code snippets written by us.Please add your code in the suggested locations.**\n","\n","Ethics Code:\n","1. You are welcome to read up online resources to implement the code. \n","2. You can also discuss with your classmates on the implmentation over Slack.\n","3. But, the code you wirte and submit should be yours ONLY. Your code will be compared against other stduents' code and online code snippets to check for plagiarism. If your code is found to be plagiarised, you will be awarded zero-marks for all assignments, which have a 10% wieghtage in the final marks for this course."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ZxSRJ4KT3OMw"},"source":["# Corpus to be used for this assignment\n","\n","corpus = [\n","     'this is the first document mostly',\n","     'this document is the second document',\n","     'and this is the third one',\n","     'is this the first document here',\n","]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"aYoKXNsU3nhO"},"source":["def computeTFIDF (corpus):\n","  '''Custom script to compute TFIDF'''\n","  WordsList = set()\n","  wordTFlist = list()\n","  Corpuslength= len(corpus)\n","  wordTFIDFList = list()\n","  \n","  #Custom Script to compute TF Matrix\n","  for sent in corpus:\n","    for words in sent.split(' '):\n","      WordsList.add(words)\n","  for sent in corpus:\n","    WordTFCountDict = dict()\n","    wordTFArray = list()\n","    for word in sent.split(' '):\n","      if WordTFCountDict.get(word)==None:\n","        count = 0\n","      else:\n","        count = 1\n","      WordTFCountDict[word] = count+1\n","    for word in sent.split(' '):\n","      wordTFArray.append(WordTFCountDict[word]/len(sent.split(' ')))\n","    wordTFlist.append(wordTFArray)\n","  \n","  #Custom Script to compute IDF Matrix\n","  WordIDFDict = dict()\n","  for word in WordsList:\n","    Doc_Count = 0\n","    for sent in corpus:\n","      if word in sent.split(' '):\n","        Doc_Count += 1\n","        continue\n","    #if Doc_Count != 0 and \n","    WordIDFDict[word] = np.log(Corpuslength/Doc_Count)\n","  \n","  #Custom Script to compute TF-IDF Matrix\n","  row=0\n","  for sent in corpus:\n","    wordIDFList = list()\n","    col=0\n","    for word in sent.split(' '):\n","      wordIDFList.append(round(wordTFlist[row][col]*WordIDFDict[word],2))\n","      col+=1\n","    row+=1\n","    wordTFIDFList.append(wordIDFList)\n","  \n","  return np.array(wordTFIDFList)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cZ_hmMn92bEe"},"source":["# Grader Cell\n","Please execute the following Grader cell to verify the correctness of your above implementation.
